# About this Project
This project was created with the goal of improving my algorithmic thinking and data structure skills, aiming to become a more capable and well-prepared professional for technical challenges. In each code solution, I thoroughly document my thought process, the difficulties I encountered, and the understanding I gained throughout the process.

I believe this approach not only reinforces my learning but also demonstrates my continuous growth and ability to solve problems in a structured and efficient way. This repository serves as a portfolio of my programming skills, using LeetCode as a platform for practice and development.
